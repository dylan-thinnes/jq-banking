All of my banking history is exported from Bank Of Scotland in CSV format,
available in years in `raw/`.

`./generate-bank-history` takes these CSVs, converts them to JSON, concatenates
them into a single JSON blob, cleans them up, and writes the result to
`./bank-history.json`.

All scripts import `utils.jq`, which provides `bank-history.json` in the
`all_data` variable, and utilities for querying it.
